/**First I went for kafka by using kafkajs but later I moved to redis and bullmq after
 * seeing the following messsage from my conversation with claude:
 * "A Kafka topic has no native index on message key — "find the message with key X" means either
 * scanning the partition from the earliest offset (linear, gets slower as the topic grows,
 * genuinely bad fit for a live status check) or standing up a compacted topic plus
 * Kafka Streams/ksqlDB to materialize a queryable state store on top. That second option
 * is a real pattern (it's how you'd build this at actual scale) — but notice what it is: an extra system
 * whose entire purpose is turning Kafka's log back into something with point lookups. You already
 * have that system. It's Postgres, and it's already in your design. Kafka strength shows up when you need
 * to audit what had happened over a period of time, and need to replay events.

/**Simpler, fewer moving parts, genuinely fine for a lot of pipelines.
 * I'd still keep them separate for this specific project,
 * for one concrete reason that matters here more than usual:
 * cost asymmetry and retry blast radius.
 * Vision and embedding are both paid Gemini calls, tracked per-call in
 * cost_log. If tagging succeeds and embedding fails (rate limit, transient network error),
 * the merged worker's retry re-runs tagImage too, since BullMQ retries
 * the whole job — you'd re-bill a Gemini vision call that already succeeded,
 * purely because the second unrelated step failed. With separate queues,
 * a failed embed job retries only the embed step; the tag job is already completed and stays that way.
 * Two secondary reasons that are real but smaller: independent
 * concurrency tuning — Gemini's vision free tier and embeddings free tier likely have different
 * rate limits, and separate queues let you set concurrency: 5 on one and concurrency: 10 on the other;
 * a merged worker forces one concurrency setting on calls with different rate ceilings.
 * And independent status visibility — getJobStatus("vision", imageId) vs getJobStatus("embed", imageId)
 * lets you answer "did tagging fail or did embedding fail" without inspecting job internals;
 * a merged job just tells you the whole thing failed somewhere.
